Looking at the vegetarian and regular meals ordered from the food recipe box providers Gousto and Hello Fresh. Recipes not my own.
Exploring the differences between the vegetarian and meat-based meals nutritionally.

Ultimate goal is to test to see if the fibre content of a meal can be predicted from the other macronutrients.
This will then be able to be used for Hello Fresh recipe boxes, who do not provide a fibre content.
This will be a prediction of limited accuracy, as the data are provided by different companies (i.e. not standardised), however, this aims to be a rough prediction.
I do not expect it to work - but lets explore!
